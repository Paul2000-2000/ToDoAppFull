Technologies Used: React, Node.js with Express, TypeScript, MongoDB

Frontend
For the frontend, I developed a responsive interface using React with TypeScript, ensuring smooth and dynamic user interactions across different device sizes. Key installations included:

npm install for initializing the project.
npm install react-icons for easily adding icons to enhance UI design.

To launch the frontend locally, use:

npm start to start the development server.

Deployment: Hosted on Netlify for fast, reliable, and scalable deployment.


Backend
On the backend, I built a robust server using Node.js with Express and TypeScript, creating an efficient and scalable API. Key installations were:

npm install express to set up the Express framework.
npm install mongodb for MongoDB integration, enabling seamless data storage and retrieval.

To run the backend locally:

npm run build to compile the TypeScript code.
node dist/index.js to launch the server from the compiled files.

Deployment: Deployed on Heroku, offering a reliable, production-ready environment.
